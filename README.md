# Customer_Churn_ANN

I have developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based churn prediction model, leveraging a telecom churn dataset sourced from Kaggle. This model holds significance within sectors such as telecommunications, internet services, pay TV, insurance, and alarm monitoring. These industries actively employ customer attrition analysis and attrition rates as pivotal business metrics. The rationale underlying this practice is rooted in the economic advantage of retaining established clientele over acquiring new customers. Notably, enterprises operating in these sectors maintain dedicated customer service divisions aimed at re-engaging and retaining customers who are at risk of churning. This strategic approach is underscored by the recognition that reclaimed long-term customers yield considerably greater value compared to newly acquired clients. Consequently, this emphasis on customer retention stands as a prudent business strategy for fostering sustainable growth.
